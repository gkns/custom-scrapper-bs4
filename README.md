# sample-scrapper-bs4
A crude website scraper in Python using Selenium and BeutifulSoup 4

Done for a personal project.

start_url.list     --> List of start pages, from where product list is created.
products_link.list --> List of product URLs generated from above start URLs

Selenium is not really necessary, requests could substitute this,
Kept Selenium on safer side, to avoid bot-blocker and is there arises any need for more UI interactions.
